  abstract  = {Keeping up with the Python ecosystem can be daunting. Its developer tooling doesn't provide the out-of-the-box experience native to languages like Rust and Go. When it comes to long-term project maintenance or collaborating with others, every Python project faces the same problem: how to build reliable workflows beyond local development while staying in sync with the evolving ecosystem.

With this hands-on guide, Python developers will learn how to forge the moving parts of a Python project into an easy-to-use toolchain, using state-of-the-art tools including Poetry, Nox, pytest, mypy, pre-commit, Black, Ruff, uv, Rye, Hatch, and more. Author Claudio Jolowicz shows you how to create robust Python project structures complete with unit tests, static analysis, code formatting, and type checking.},
